# SuperGenPass Chrome Extension

A simple and straightforward [SuperGenPass](https://chriszarate.github.io/supergenpass/) Chrome Extension for those of us who don't want to use the bookmarklet or for those browsers that don't support bookmarklets (I'm looking at you, Vivaldi !)

<br/>

## Motivation

Actually, this is the reason why I wrote this extension, since I'm using Vivaldi as my main browser and it has some weird bug that doesn't allow me to run the SuperGenPass bookmarklet.

The extension is a basic React app (boilerplate generated by `create-react-app`)

<br/>

## Privacy and other concerns

The only permission that the extension needs is `activeTab`. 

Besides this, the extension doesn't make any network calls and doesn't store any kind of information.

For the hashing algorithm, I used the [official Javascript implementation of SuperGenPass](https://github.com/chriszarate/supergenpass-lib) installed as a npm module.

## Manually installing the extension

1. clone this repository
2. open a terminal, navigate to where you've cloned the repo and run `npm i`
3. run `npm run build`. This will create a `build` folder.
4. open any Chrome based browser, type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar
5. enable `Developer mode` by flicking the switch on the top-right corner
6. click on the `Load unpacked` button and select the aforementioned `build` folder

## Power (a.k.a. lazy) users

If you're like me and you don't want to write your master password each time you want to generate a password for a website (please don't judge), I implemented a possible workflow for this scenario - you can inject a local environment variable into the `build` folder.

Just follow the steps described above, but instead of `step 3`, do the following:
- create a `env.development` file
- add a `REACT_APP_MASTER_PASSWORD` variable into the file
  - example: `REACT_APP_MASTER_PASSWORD=this_is_my_master_password`
- run `npm run build:development`.
- continue with the next steps described above
